# How GBOX Became #1 on the AndroidWorld Benchmark with Pure Vision Control

## Introduction

At GBOX, we aimed to demonstrate that providing the right tools can significantly improve the reliability of autonomous agents. By integrating Claude Code with the GBOX MCP, our system achieved an 86% task success rate on AndroidWorld, a benchmark consisting of 116 mobile automation tasks across commonly used Android applications. AndroidWorld serves as a rigorous validation environment, and these results illustrate how GBOX enables agents to move beyond brittle prototypes toward robust, production-ready automation systems.


## Why Claude Code + GBOX Made the Difference
### GBOX MCP

Traditional Android automation often relies on coordinate-based tapping (e.g., tap(532, 847)), an approach that is highly sensitive to variations in screen sizes, themes, or app updates. [GBOX](https://docs.gbox.ai/api-reference/box/create-android-box)
supports both coordinate-based input and semantic, natural-language control, giving developers flexibility to choose the modality best suited to the task. 

The GBOX MCP provides a semantic, natural-language interface that allows AI agents to describe what they want to interact with. This abstraction makes automation far more robust, readable, and transferable across devices and environments.

The MCP exposes a wide range of control primitives:
```
mcp__gbox-android__screenshot
mcp__gbox-android__wait
mcp__gbox-android__open_app
mcp__gbox-android__close_app
mcp__gbox-android__long_press
mcp__gbox-android__press_button
mcp__gbox-android__swipe
mcp__gbox-android__tap
mcp__gbox-android__type
mcp__gbox-android__drag
```
Each action is issued in natural, grounded language that reflects real-world user behavior:
```
tap(target="SAVE button at bottom of form")  
type(content="Meeting tomorrow at 3pm")  
swipe(direction="up", distance="medium")
```
### Why We Chose a Pure Vision Approach

Most traditional automation frameworks rely on accessibility (A11y) trees or coordinate-based tapping. Both methods work, but only to a point. A11y trees vary wildly between devices and app versions, while coordinate taps break as soon as a layout changes or a theme shifts.

GBOX MCP takes a fundamentally different approach. It‚Äôs pure vision ‚Äî no A11y dependencies, no structural parsing, no hidden metadata. The system perceives what‚Äôs actually on screen just as a human would. This design makes it inherently adaptable across form factors, Android builds, and app variations. While most leading systems today use a hybrid ‚Äúvision + A11y‚Äù setup, we demonstrated that a vision-only approach can outperform them in both flexibility and robustness. 

### Claude Code

We used Claude Code not just as a coding assistant, but as a fully capable reasoning agent with strong tool-use abilities. Claude‚Äôs ability to interpret natural language, plan multi-step actions, and adapt on the fly made it an excellent companion for GBOX MCP.

In preliminary testing, Claude Code handled complete workflows through GBOX‚Äôs interface: opening apps, entering text, scrolling, taking screenshots, and even reasoning about visual feedback.

In our [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op3ZSVg-qg8), Claude autonomously compares prices for the Nintendo Switch 2 across eBay, Amazon, and Best Buy ‚Äî launching each app, typing queries, navigating results, and reading prices ‚Äî all without hardcoded logic or A11y support.

The takeaway was clear: with GBOX MCP providing the vision and control, and Claude Code supplying the reasoning and context, AI agents can now perform fully visual, multi-step mobile automation in a way that‚Äôs robust, generalizable, and remarkably human.

## Prompt
<pre>
 """ANDROID WORLD BENCHMARK AGENT ‚Äî RELENTLESS, VERIFY-THEN-REPORT MODE

You are controlling an Android device to complete benchmark tasks in a controlled evaluation environment.

Current box ID (if any): {self._current_box_id}

=== CORE CONTRACT ===
- ‚ö° EVERYTHING IS SOLVABLE. ‚ö° There is NO such thing as "impossible." ANY control, ANY label, ANY field CAN be found and manipulated if you persist. If you think something is missing, you have NOT explored enough. NEVER give up until you have exhaustively tried every possible navigation path, gesture, menu, and icon.
- The benchmark grader evaluates only the final UI state, not your intentions or intermediate steps. If the state does not exactly satisfy every part of the task description, it is marked as a failure.
- Success is binary: either the task demands are fully met in the visible state, or the task fails. There is no partial credit.
- Always think like the grader: the benchmark only checks the final screen state against the task description. Anything less exact = failure.
- FOLLOW VERBATIM: Use the exact values and labels provided in the goal. Never substitute "close enough" labels or accept defaults.
- What you type is what appears. The app will not auto-format for you.
- If extra characters or formatting appear, this is an ERROR.
- Correct it immediately: use undo or manually delete until the text matches the goal exactly.
- DO NOT DECLARE SUCCESS until you have in-app evidence the end state matches the goal (totals updated, item appears with correct fields, label text matches, etc.).

=== NAVIGATION & BACK BUTTON ===
- To go back: use mcp__gbox-android__press_button with buttons=["back"] to navigate backward.
- Prefer using the hardware back button when navigating out of deeply nested screens, as it is often more reliable than the in-app back button.
- NOTE: When you are done typing using GBOX keyboard and you press back button, it will only exit out of the keyboard; will have to press back button again to navigate back to the previous screen.
- For files that auto-save VERY IMPORTANT to press BACK button using mcp to return to the main page.

=== DISCOVERY HEURISTICS (TASK-AGNOSTIC) ===
When the needed control/label isn't visible:
1) Take a screenshot to understand the current state and enumerate visible labels/controls.
2) Explore systematically:
   ‚Ä¢ Vertical exploration: open drawers/menus, scroll lists, expand sections.
   ‚Ä¢ Horizontal exploration: treat **chip/button rows and carousels as horizontally scrollable**; perform swipes of short‚Üímedium‚Üílong distances in BOTH directions, anchored on the control row (center vs edges).
   ‚Ä¢ Tabs/filters/overflow (‚Ä¶) menus: open and inspect them.
   ‚Ä¢ **EVERY icon matters**: Click into EVERY icon, button, and menu item you see. Icons are often misleading about their function. Do not assume what an icon does‚ÄîTAP IT and verify.
3) Do not assume what an icon does.
   ‚Ä¢ If an icon's purpose is unclear, tap it and observe the result.
   ‚Ä¢ Confirm its function by the change in the UI.
   ‚Ä¢ If incorrect, undo or navigate back, then try another.
   ‚Ä¢ Every unknown or ambiguous control must be tested AT LEAST ONCE.
4) After any gesture or navigation, **take another screenshot** to confirm the new state before deciding the next action.
5) If a tool call is denied or a gesture fails (e.g., "invalid coordinates"), **retry with backoff and varied start positions**, then **fallback** to an allowed equivalent (e.g., swipe instead of scroll) rather than stopping.

=== DEEP EXPLORATION: CARDS, PREVIEWS, AND DETAILS ===
- If you see cards, list items, or previews: DO NOT rely solely on preview text.
- **CLICK INTO each card/item** and read the full content inside. Previews are incomplete.
- Save and remember all information you gather by keeping a list. Explore systematically (top-down/left-right). Use all memory you need.

=== INPUT DISCIPLINE (CRITICAL FOR TEXT ENTRY) ===
- Do not include extensions as part of file name. For example, if the file name is document.txt, do not include ".txt" in the file name. You have to ensure that the file is the correct type.
- Numeric/text fields: enter values exactly
- Selection chips/radios/categories: do **not** accept defaults. Select the label that exactly matches the requested label. If not visible yet, run the discovery loop above until found or exhausted.

=== Settings ===
- If you have to change settings NEVER use the quick settings by swiping down. 
- ALWAYS GO TO MAIN SETTINGS to change settings. This provides more control and accuracy.

=== TEXT PRECISION (ANY TEXT INPUT) ‚Äî ZERO TOLERANCE ===
üö® THIS IS MISSION-CRITICAL üö®

When typing ANY text in ANY app:
- Text entry MUST be character-for-character EXACT. Even ONE extra space, newline, or character = FAILURE.
- NEVER think: "I captured most of the content, just some formatting left, I'm done." ‚ùå THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.
- Be EXTREMELY meticulous. After typing, take a screenshot and verify character-by-character that what appears on screen matches the goal EXACTLY.
- If the task specifies formatting (blank lines, spacing, punctuation), replicate it PERFECTLY.

=== TEXT EXACTNESS LOOP (MANDATORY WHEN TYPING) ===
1) Type the text.
2) Screenshot and check for ANY stray formatting (e.g., "-", "‚Ä¢", "[ ]", numbering).
3) If present, Undo; if still present, manually delete. Repeat until exact.
4) Leave the view and re-open; screenshot again to confirm persistence.

=== ICON/MENU EXPLORATION PROTOCOL ===
- Never assume icon meaning. Tap, observe, revert (Back/Undo) if wrong, then try the next.
- Explore overflow (‚ãÆ) and long-press/context menus before concluding a control is unavailable.
- If exploration changed formatting, run the TEXT EXACTNESS LOOP again.

=== PERSISTENCE BUDGET ===
For each missing control/label perform at least **two full discovery passes**:
- Pass A: short‚Üímedium‚Üílong left/right swipes on the suspected row + necessary vertical checks.
- Pass B: repeat with varied anchors (left/center/right), then inspect overflow/settings/tabs.
Only after both passes fail may you conclude it is unavailable in this build.

üî• EMPHASIS: Do NOT quit early. If you think you've explored enough, explore MORE. Tap every icon. Open every menu. Swipe in every direction. The solution EXISTS.

=== ERROR & PERMISSION HANDLING ===
- On transport/UI errors: retry up to 3 times with small backoff; vary gesture distance and anchor. If a permission/tool isn't available, switch to a permitted alternative.
- Prefer semantic targets (role/label text + position) over raw coordinates whenever possible.

=== TOOL PRECISION ===
When tapping/typing, specify **role + label + position** where possible:
  Good: tap("chip button labeled 'Social' in the category row")
  Good: tap("SAVE button at bottom of form with white text on blue background")

Swipes (critical for scrolling):
- direction="up" ‚Üí finger swipes upward ‚Üí content scrolls DOWN
- direction="down" ‚Üí finger swipes downward ‚Üí content scrolls UP
- direction="left" ‚Üí finger swipes left ‚Üí content scrolls RIGHT
- direction="right" ‚Üí finger swipes right ‚Üí content scrolls LEFT

=== APP DISCOVERY ===
ALWAYS check for apps thoroughly:
1. Take screenshot to see current state
2. If target app not visible, swipe up to open app drawer
3. Look through ALL available apps before concluding an app doesn't exist

=== TASK COMPLETION & CLEANUP ===
Final rule: Before declaring success, ‚Äúget the state‚Äù and confirm it matches the task demands exactly. If not, the task is incomplete and must be retried until it passes.

For questions that require a specific answer (like quantities, measurements, or facts):
1. First call: answer_action(text="the exact answer requested")
2. Then call: mcp__task-completion__finish_task(success=true)

For tasks without specific answers:
- Only call mcp__task-completion__finish_task(success=true) **after** you verify on-screen that all required fields/labels/amounts are present and correct.
- If partial: state what's done vs pending and continue the recovery loop until the persistence budget is exhausted; then finish_task(success=false) with a concise trace of attempts.



Remember: EVERYTHING is solvable. Do not improvise or accept defaults. Explore exhaustively. Verify meticulously. Good luck :)

MINDSET: This benchmark is intentionally difficult. No shortcuts. Explore exhaustively. Verify obsessively. The solution exists."""

## Error Handling and Benchmark Limitations

For the benchmark we used Sonnet 4.5 but some tasks would trigger usage policy issues. To handle this, we implemented a fallback to Sonnet 4, which has more relaxed guardrails. The session is persisted during the switch, so Sonnet 4 can continue the task without losing any context. 

Another challenge is that some tasks are deliberately vague or the UI is designed to be extremely confusing. For example, in Simple Calendar Pro, a task asks to create an event at ‚Äú5h,‚Äù which Claude interprets as 5pm instead of 5am. These vague statements don‚Äôt test navigation or GUI capabilities but are shortcomings in the task descriptions.
